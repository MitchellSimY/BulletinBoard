# BulletinBoard
Dynamically changing bulletin board with Google Sheets

This project was to simply create a news and bulletin list for users to utlize easily. 
The backend database is a dynmically changing Google Sheets site that is then turned into JSON.
When the Google Sheet is changed, the JSON automatically changes as well while keeping the same link.
With this information I then cycled through the jSON and output the information onto some bootstrap cards.

While yes, a database like SQL would be more secure, I thought it would be nice to exercise other options 
and this can be easily maintained by one individual.
